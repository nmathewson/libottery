 * thread at a time, your program's behavior will be undefined. It might
 * crash. It might insecurely give the same random sequence to multiple
 * threads.  It might fail in strange ways that you'd never predict.
 *
 * An ottery_state_nolock structure is constucted with ottery_st_init().  It
 * MUST be aligned on a 16-byte boundary.

 * You may not use an ottery_state_nolock structure with any other function
 * before you have first initialized it with ottery_st_init_nolock().

 * defined to be large enough so that programs that allocate it will get
